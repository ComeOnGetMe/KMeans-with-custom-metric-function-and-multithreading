KMeans with custom metric function and multithreading
===========
**An implementation of K-Means algorithm in Python that supports custom metric functions and multithread-computing for distance matrix.**

Evaluating different prototype selection methods with different metrics.
Dataset: MNIST 
Custom metric: tangent distance (as an example)
